# study-angular2
It's my initial study using Angular 2. 


## the study project.

After watching the Angular course from Mosh Hamedani at Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-tutorial-for-beginners/ ) I decided to try it !


For this project I used Angular 2 (from course), JsonPlaceholder(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)and Bootstrap for design.

##### If you find any better aproache, please, let me know! I love to learn some new skills.
